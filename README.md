# FM_Squad_Depth_Tool

## Introduction

A simple Tkinter GUI where you can import a data export of player attributes from FM and make custom role aggregation scores to then visualise squad depth on a pitch. This was my first project!

This is for personal use, so instructions are not included but it involves using a custom filter on Football Manager to get data export with player attributes.
